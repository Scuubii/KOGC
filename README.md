# PC Optimization guide - Scuubi


## This is a complete walkthrough on most of what I know about hardware / software on both Intel and AMD. If by the end (and after reading the FAQ) you still have questions and or problems, I'll gladly answer on the discord linked to my GitHub profile.

Excuse any typos, I won't really be proof-reading this as it's way too much to go over again . . .


Anyways you're free to skip to whatever part you want, I'll do my best to seperate everyhing in differnt sections and whatnot, this will be a long unorganized rant that hopefully helps someone.


ALL LOVE <3
