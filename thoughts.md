# Final thoughts / opinions

I will be adding more to this guide as time goes on so any of this might change at any time

With that being said, the latency rabbit hole is deep and mostly pointless, yeah it's great to be marginally faster then your opponentes but at the end of the day if you're doing this out of 
anything but curiosity and the will to learn you're doing it wrong, if this is JUSt to gain a competitive edge in games you're really not going to find it here, what helps you more then reading 
my or any other guide is... guess what? Being good at games! it's still you, you're moving the mouse, it's you playing, fine motor control will always be more important then computer latency.
Don't waste your time, the only reason I do this and the only reason I wrote this entire thing is because I enjoy computers, I'm learning Computer Science and this is a GREAT way to learn,
I do logic simulations and learned most of what I know off other guides, trying and failing and simulations, computers are fun, that's why I tinker with them and mess around with settings, 
not to gain an advantage... If you're passionate and want to learn, you can ask me anything on my discord, it's linked to my GitHub profile, I'll answer any question.

What's been said here and what is in the guides I linked is still considered computer science, don't worry if you can't understand or replicate or understand most of this, you'll get there, 
it takes time and a lot of learning, keep in mind, these aren't just buy and configure machines, they are still exterme feats of us, humans, A LOT of small bits go into making a working computer,
more then you know, more then I know, It's truly fascinating what we've achieved as a species, mass computation is the first step to a autonomous society where automation is a norm not a luxury,
and I'm all for it.

LOVE YOU <3
