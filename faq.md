# FAQ

## 1. After tweaking my Windows, I can't boot back into it.
Use a restore point or completely reinstall Windows again, take not of what broke it and don't do it next time. note: services are usually the cause of complete windows bricks.

## 2. My hardware isn't getting detected !!!
If anything isn't getting detected the first step is to re-seat the component, unplug and plug it back in, if it still has a problem try see if you can install any drivers for said component, if not try the same component in another working computer.

## 3. Your guide (or a guide that was linked here) broke my PC !!!
Your PC is fine, re-install Windows and try again, nothing that has been written here has the chance of permanently damaging components, everything is resetable.

## 4. I need help with something.
Either use Google, or tag me in the server linked on my Linktre, I'll gladly answer questions.

## 5. I've already done everyhing here and in the guides that were linked and my games still feel heavy and slow !!!
Some latency problems can't be fixed by hardware / software, some are internet related, some are related to the way your house is built and your specific electrical system, if you live near powerlines this can influence how wireless devices work, EMI si real.

## 6. More to come lol.
