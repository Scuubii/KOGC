# BIOS / INTER-SETUP

Welcome to the next step congrats on surviving the hardware rant! More of that to come...
Why call this INTER-SETUP? Simple: it’s the stage between the PRE-SETUP and POST-SETUP. Deal with it.

# BIOS Configuration Overview

The BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) is a powerful and complex part of your system, and there's a lot you can tweak here. Rather than telling you what to do i'll link some guides.

## Before You Begin

Before you dive into the BIOS, familiarize yourself with the CMOS battery and how to reset it. If your BIOS settings ever mess things up, resetting the CMOS will bring everything back to factory defaults. Many high quality motherboards have a dedicated button for this, saving you from taking apart your computer.


## Unhiding Advanced BIOS Settings

Some BIOS options are hidden by default. To unlock them, you’ll need tools like GRUB and SCEWIN. Most of the guides I’ll link use SCEWIN, which I highly recommend.

## Final Thoughts on BIOS Tuning

The BIOS can be overwhelming at times, but remember you can always Load optimized defaults or in the worst case scenario reflash the bios entierly, resetting everything you've done to stock values.
