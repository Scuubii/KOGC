# LATENCY: Definition and Thoughts


Understanding Latency and Its Impact on System Performance
Latency is a critical concept when evaluating the responsiveness of a system. In this section, I’ll explain what latency is, why it matters, and how it influences your experience when using a computer.

The most important latency metric is End-to-End Latency. This measures the time from when you press a button (e.g., left-click) to when the corresponding action appears on your monitor. This is the only number that truly affects your experience.

Other forms of latency measurements, while interesting, are incomplete in understanding real-world performance. For example:


DPC (Deferred Procedure Call) latency and IPC (Instructions Per Cycle) counts are often overemphasized. They represent a very small part of the overall latency chain.


# Defining Latency


Latency is an artificial metric, typically expressed in milliseconds (ms), used to describe the physical and virtual delay between actions. Lower latency translates to a more fluid, responsive, and snappy experience.

However, it’s essential to focus not only on reducing latency but also on minimizing fluctuations in latency. Let’s explore why.


# Stability Over Minimum Latency


While achieving low latency is valuable, stability is even more critical. Deviations and averages dictate the overall experience more than hitting the lowest possible latency number.

Here’s an example:

Imagine a casual gamer playing Valorant at 60 FPS, but with wildly fluctuating frame times. Even a weekend gamer would notice the inconsistency and describe the experience as feeling "off."
Now, give the same person a 45 FPS game (theoretically, with perfectly stable frame times). They are less likely to complain about performance because the experience feels consistent.
This highlights the importance of reducing latency deviations. A stable latency number, even if slightly higher, will always feel better than a lower latency with frequent fluctuations.


# Final Thoughts on Latency and Its Role in Gameplay


While system latency is undoubtedly important and can provide a competitive edge, it’s not the ultimate deciding factor. At the end of the day, it’s your skill, fine motor control, and ability to adapt that truly determine success.

## Remember: You matter more than your system. Fine motor control and precise movements will always outweigh a minor reduction in virtual latency.
