# LATENCY, the definition and my thoughts on it.

## I want to talk about what latency itself is, what it means and what affects your experience when using a system.



I want to start by saying that the only important latency figure is End to End latency, that means the time from you pressing left click
to seeing it on your monitor, that's the only number that we care about, any other way of benchmarking latency is flawed.

DPC and IPC counts don't matter as much as you think, this is a VERY small part of the latency chain.

I'll define latency to the best of my abilities here:

- Latency is a artifical number usually provided to us in miliseconds, that tries to describe the physical and virtual "delay" between actions

Minimizing said number will lead to a more fluid, responsive and snappy experience.

## important, maximum numbers aren't that important, deviations and averages are law.

I mean that most people will MUCH easily notice a deviation in latency rather then a complete reduction, let me explain:

Let's give a theoretical casual gamer a 60 FPS game of Valorant, now make the frametimes fluctuate wildly, even a casual weekend gamer 
will be able to notice this, he'll complain about the game feeling "off"

Now give the same person a 45 FPS game of Valorant with perfect frame times (not possible), no fluctuations, and don't tell him that you decreased the FPS.
The same person will not think you "fixed" that heavy, dragging feeling, this is the important of latency deviations, we want to
achieve a STABLE latency number, not necesarily the lowest, no fluctuations will feel better than a millisecond reduction with deviations.


##While I think system latency is important and does offer a competitive advantage, at the end of the day it's you moving the mouse, it's you playing
you matter more then your system, fine motor control will always rule over virtual latency.
